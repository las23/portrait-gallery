# Portrait Gallery

A dynamic portrait gallery with flowing portraits and a permanent profile panel.

## Features

- Two-column layout with flowing portraits on the left and a profile panel on the right
- Portraits flow upwards with different layers (front, middle, back)
- Varying portrait sizes and animation speeds
- Permanent profile panel visible on the right side
- System prevents duplicate portraits from appearing simultaneously

## Structure

- **index.html**: Main HTML structure
- **styles.css**: CSS styling using flexbox for the layout
- **scripts.js**: JavaScript for portrait initialization and animation

## How It Works

The gallery has a main layout div with a container div for portraits and a profile panel div. The portraits flow upwards with different layers, sizes, and speeds, while the profile panel remains permanently visible on the right side.
